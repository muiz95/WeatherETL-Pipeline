# WeatherETL-Pipeline
This project demonstrates how to build and automate an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, transform it, and load the processed data into an AWS S3 bucket. The pipeline is entirely orchestrated and automated on an AWS EC2 instance.
